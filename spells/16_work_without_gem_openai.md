There are two gems: 'ruby-openai' and 'openai'

But the usage is the same:
```ruby
require "openai"

# do things... 
```

is there any way to check what gem is actually been required? or force it to require the specific gem, say 'ruby-openai'

ASSISTANT:
In Ruby, if two different gems provide the same filename to be required (like `require "openai"`), the gem that is listed first in your Gemfile (or .gemspec file) or the one that is installed first (if you're not using Bundler) will typically be the one that is loaded. However, this can lead to ambiguity and cause the wrong gem to be required if you're not careful.

To ensure that you are requiring the correct gem, one way is to be explicit in your project's Gemfile by specifying the gem you want to use. 

For example:

```ruby
# Gemfile

gem 'ruby-openai'
# gem 'openai' # Comment out or remove the gem you do not want to use.
```

After modifying your Gemfile, run `bundle install` to install the dependencies accordingly. Be sure to require the gems in your code after requiring 'bundler/setup' to ensure that Bundler sets up the load path correctly.

```ruby
require 'bundler/setup' 
Bundler.require

require 'openai'

# do things...
```

If you're not using Bundler, ensure that only the desired gem is installed in your Ruby environment, or if both gems are needed for different purposes, you might want to manage separate environments using tools like RVM or rbenv.


If you find that the wrong gem is being loaded, you can use `$LOAD_PATH` (or its alias `$:`) to check the load path and determine which paths are being searched for the require statement. You could also use `gem which` command to find the location of a specific gem's main file.

```bash
gem which openai
```

If there is still ambiguity or if you need to differentiate the same file required by two different gems, you will likely have to either rename the required files within the gems (which would require forking or otherwise modifying the gem, not generally recommended) or work with the maintainers of the gems to resolve the naming conflict.

If you are the creator or a contributor to one of these gems, consider namespacing the require paths with the gem name to avoid such clashes (e.g., `require "ruby-openai/openai"`).

Lastly, there's also the possibility to directly require the file from its install path, although this is more of a hack and might break the conventional use of gems:

```ruby
require '/path/to/gem/lib/openai.rb'
```

You would have to replace '/path/to/gem/lib/openai.rb' with the actual path to the gem you want to use. This is not recommended for general use but can serve as a last resort or for debugging purposes.
