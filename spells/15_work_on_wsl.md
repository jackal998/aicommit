I'm working on a project that should be able to run on all ubuntu system on ruby.
But on WSL, it seems not working with the magic comment:

bin/aicommit
```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require "optparse"
require "colorize"
require_relative "../lib/aicommit"
require_relative "../lib/aicommit/version"

options = {}
parser = OptionParser.new do |op|
  op.banner = "Usage: aicommit [options]"

  op.on("-v", "--version", "Show version") do |v|
    options[:version] = v
  end

  op.on("-c", "--config", "Set OpenAI API token") do |c|
    options[:config] = c
  end
end

parser.parse!

if options[:version]
  puts Aicommit::VERSION
elsif options[:config]
  TokenManager.new.write!("OPENAI_API_TOKEN")
elsif ARGV.empty?
  Aicommit.new.run
else
  puts parser.help
end
```

```stdout
/mnt/c/Users/J/repository/aicommit develop
❯ bin/aicommit     
/usr/bin/env: ‘ruby\r’: No such file or directory
/mnt/c/Users/J/repository/aicommit develop ?1
❯
```

ASSISTANT:
The issue you are encountering is typically due to the file `bin/aicommit` containing Windows-style line endings (`\r\n`) instead of Unix-style line endings (`\n`). The error message `/usr/bin/env: ‘ruby\r’: No such file or directory` indicates that `env` is trying to execute a command named `ruby\r` (which includes the carriage return character `\r`), but no such command exists.

When you're working with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), it is important to ensure that scripts intended to run in a Linux environment use Unix-style line endings. This can happen if you create or edit the file using a Windows-based text editor that defaults to Windows line endings.

To fix the problem:

1. Convert the line endings to Unix style. You can do this by using a text editor that allows you to change line endings or by using a command-line tool like `dos2unix`:

```bash
dos2unix bin/aicommit
```

2. Make sure the file has the right permissions to be executable. If not, you can change the permissions using `chmod`:

```bash
chmod +x bin/aicommit
```

3. After converting the line endings and making sure the file is executable, try running the script again in WSL.

You may want to configure your text editor to always use Unix-style line endings for files destined to be run within a Unix-based environment like WSL. If you're using Git, you can also configure it to automatically handle line ending conversions correctly with the following settings:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

This tells Git to convert line endings to Unix style when you check in files and avoids changing them when you check out files on a system that uses WSL or Linux. When working solely within Unix-like systems, it's better to disable the line ending conversion completely:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

To apply this to a specific repository, omit the `--global` flag and run the commands within the repository's directory.

Please keep in mind that these configurations should be chosen based on your project's requirements and your development environment. If you are sharing a codebase with developers on different platforms, ensure that everyone has a clear understanding of the line ending conventions to be used, and consider documenting the setup in your project's contribution guidelines.
